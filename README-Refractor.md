# Refractor-Homework

# Aim of Project
**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology

# Client story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Description
- I have refracted the HTML file by changing the old code and replacing it with semantic HTML elements to ensure that any user that may have any disability can still access the website by using assistive technlogies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

- Apart from tag elements nothing else in the code was change and the functionality of the website should not have been compromised.

- Most <div> tags were replaced by more accurate semantic elements such as <header>, <aside>, <footer>, <nav>.
